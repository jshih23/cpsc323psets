# Homework 1: Farthing

### Estimated Time: 
18 hours

### Log
* 9/3/2018 - 10:00-11:30 - Read pset spec and started coding


### Total Time: 
1.5 hr

### Collaboration: 
I discussed my answers with myself.

### Discussion
The program specification is long and dense. There are a lot of details to pay attention to. I have a general idea of what I want to accomplish, so I think the best approach for now is to start coding and to add the details later.
